file reut2-017.sgm wasn't encoded in utf-8 initially so I converted it before reading the file

initially unable to extract all titles and body text for each of the 21578 articles.
To read the body content of all the articles, I had to change my line of code from
    body = article.find('body')
to
    body = article.find('body') or article.find('text') or article.find('content')
because some articles use different tags.

However, I was unable to extract 21578 titles because 737 articles have missing titles.

I chose to move forward without extracting all the titles.
